# Weather_Prediction
This project analyzes historical weather data in Pakistan from 2000 to 2020 and predicts future climate trends through 2040 using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
Data Source: Weather data stored in a SQLite database, including average temperature, rainfall, and humidity.

Data Analysis: Explores and visualizes historical weather trends with Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

Prediction: Uses Linear Regression to forecast average temperature and rainfall for the years 2021â€“2040.

Visualizations: Combines actual and predicted data for clear insights into future climate patterns.

Features
